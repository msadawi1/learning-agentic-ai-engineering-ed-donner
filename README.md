# My Agentic AI Learning Journey

## 6 Weeks of Building Autonomous AI Agents with Ed Donner

This repo is my personal space for documenting my journey into the fascinating world of **Agentic AI**. Over 3 weeks (supposedly 6, but I'll be rushing), I’ll be experimenting, coding, and deploying autonomous AI agents using tools like:

- [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview)  
- [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)  
- [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)  
- [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)  
- [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

- This repo belongs to Ed Donner: [Original Repo](https://github.com/ed-donner/agents). 
- This repo is not a polished course. It’s my **learning lab**. The content you will find will be similar to that in Ed's repo, but with extra notes and more projects applying Agentic AI solutions
